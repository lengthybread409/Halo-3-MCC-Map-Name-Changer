### Setting up Powershell for the first time.

    In an admin prompt run this command:
*Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned*

    Powershell scripts will work after this.

### Setting up this script
    
    Create a folder in any halo 3 map location, Appdata or MCC. can be name WIP
    Then move the script in that folder with all the maps you want to edit.

    edited maps will be moved in the parent directory, or into the working map folder
    
### Run Powershell
    
    When viewing the folder on explorer, click at the top left where it says "File"
    Then click "Open Windows Powershell"

    A blue screen will show. Its not the blue screen of death. This one is good!

### Running the script 
    
    How to run the script, Type this (Pressing Tab will autocomplete)
*.\MapReName.ps1*

    A list of your maps will show with an Index number and details.
    Use the index to select the map you want like dis,
*.\MapReName 1*

    You will be asked N/D/S,
    N: Change Name
    D: Change Discription
    S: Save changes

    If a map is a special type of map, there will be file created called Hand.txt.
    I cant help you at this point and you will need to do it yourself.

    THATS ALL FOLKS
