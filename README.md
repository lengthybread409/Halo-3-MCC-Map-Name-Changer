Setting up Powershell for the first time.

    In an admin prompt run this command:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

    Powershell scripts will work after this.

Setting up this script
    
    Move this script to the "Halo The Master Chief Collection"
    under the commons folder in steam.

    mcclauncher.exe will be in the same folder
    
Run Powershell
    
    When viewing the folder on explorer, click at the top left where it says "File"
    Then click "Open Windows Powershell"

    A blue screen will show. Its not the blue screen of death. This one is good!

Running the script 
    
    How to run the script, Type this (Pressing Tab will autocomplete)
